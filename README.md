This is uh... not the prettiest code I've ever written. Past a certain point, getting it to work at all took priority over brevity.

It should be fairly intuitive to run, just toss your task in the To-Do box, select your priority, add in some details if you want, and click submit.

Clear tasks gets rid of them, and clear storage gets rid of them from local memory.
